# Memory Game ðŸ§ 
This is an interactive web game where players test their memory by matching pairs of cards. Users can sign up or log in to track their scores and compete on the global scoreboard!
Built with Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS, this project combines classic gameplay with user authentication and score tracking.

### Styling
Though visual appearance wasn't my main priority, I decided to style it in a 'space' theme. The illustrations on the cards are from https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/419229-astronaut-and-rocket-in-space by Matt Cole. The color palette is from Pinterest and the font is "Poppins" from Google Fonts.
